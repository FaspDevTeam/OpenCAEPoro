OpenCAEPoro or OCP is part of the OpenCAEPlus project written in C++. OCP
focuses on simulating multicomponent multiphase flows in porous media. For 
more information, please see 
[OCP repository](https://faspdevteam.github.io/OpenCAEPoro/).

## Get Started

Check user manual and API's (class references from Doxygen) [website](https://porous.opencaeplus.org).

For full documentation generated by Doxygen, see [here](https://faspdevteam.github.io/OpenCAEPoro/).

## Install
There is a top level cmake configuration file to build the OpenCAEPoro lib 
and the associate test programs suite. You can use a cmake-style approach to 
compile the package; see [the official webpage](https://cmake.org) on how to
use cmake for your own operating system. 

Before building OpenCAEPoro, you need to make sure that BLAS, LAPACK, and FASP
are available. BLAS and LAPACK are ready on most systems. The FASP package (only 
the open-source part [faspsolver](https://github.com/FaspDevTeam/faspsolver) is 
required) can be downloaded from its GitHub repository. More solver options are
included in [fasp4blkoil](https://github.com/FaspDevTeam/fasp4blkoil).

The typical command for compiling OpenCAEPoro is:

Config the environment for building with cmake:
```bash
  >>> mkdir Build; cd Build; cmake ..
```

After successfully configuring, to make the library as well as examples without
installing them, just run:
```bash
  >>> make
```

To make the library and install it, run:
```bash
  >>> make install
```

Standard **uninstall** and **clean** targets are also provided. You may safely 
remove the **Build** directory as well. 

You may also use the provided scripts to build the whole projectï¼š
```bash
chmod 755 cli
```
```bash
./cli build -c intel -t all -b Debug # Change the argument to Release for release build
```


## Structure
The directory structure of OpenCAEPoro is designed as follows:
  - data/: Output files for comparison purposes
  - doc/: Documentation website
  - examples/: Input files for test examples 
  - external/: external dependencies
  - include/: Header files
  - src/: Source files
  - stash/: Files that are no longer needed, but keep for future references
  - main/: Main source code for executables 
  - CMakeLists.txt: Main cmake script
  - CMakePresets.json: Preset setting for cmake 
  - CONTRIBUTE.md: Guidance for open source contributors
  - LICENSE: License agreement
  - README.md: This document
  - .clang-format: For automatic source code formatting
  - cli, cli.bat: the command line interface for build, test, and doc
## Test

There are three levels of tests:
  - Unit test: for testing individual code components
  - Integrate test: for testing interfaces between components
  - System test: for testing and benchmark of the whole program  

Currently only system tests are provided in the `examples/` folder.
